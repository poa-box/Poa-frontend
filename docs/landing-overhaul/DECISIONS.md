# Landing page overhaul: decisions

Phase 6 artifact. Everything significant, with reasons. Screenshots:
`shots/before-*` (old page) and `shots/after-*` (new page, from the
production static export) at 375, 768, and 1440.

## What the audit taught

1. The product is better than the old page said, and different. There is no
   profit-sharing mechanism and no leave-with-your-money flow (both implied
   by the brief and one by the old page), but there IS a real cashout flow
   to Cash App/Venmo/bank, real named templates, real vouch quorums, and a
   permanent public decision history. The honest page writes itself from
   those.
2. The logo was already letterpress: black typewriter slab "poa" between two
   rules. The pastel gradient site fought its own mark. The charter design
   is, in a real sense, what the logo always claimed.
3. `Navbar.jsx`/`Footer.jsx` are shared with /u, /protocol, /about,
   /explore, so the overhaul built new landing-only components instead of
   restyling those in place (hard rule 5).
4. Repo constraint that shaped the motion rules: framer-motion above the
   fold bakes `opacity: 0` into the static export (PRs #437/#438), so the
   page uses the established pure-CSS `.poa-fade` pattern, and nothing else.

## Significant decisions

- **Artifacts live in `docs/landing-overhaul/`**, not the repo root: keeps
  the root clean; the brief names the files but not their location.
- **"Constitution" never appears as a noun for an artifact.** There is no
  one-page constitution document in the product; governance lives in
  contract configuration surfaced by the app. Copy says "rules" and
  "templates" (what the deployer actually shows). The word "charter" is
  used only as a design metaphor (the specimen), never as a product claim.
- **The surplus pillar from the brief was cut.** "Surplus flows back to the
  people who created it" has no mechanism in the code. The ownership pillar
  stands on what is verifiable: voting power earned by participating, not
  bought. The old page's "share of the treasury" line died for the same
  reason.
- **"The door is open" was rebuilt from true parts.** No exit flow exists,
  so the pillar claims what is real: earnings land in the member's own
  account and cash out to ordinary payment apps; the record is public; any
  org can run its own copy of the tools (white-label hosting is documented
  and live). "Leave anytime with everything" from the brief was not
  claimable and does not appear.
- **"No fees to start" became "Poa charges nothing."** Free account
  creation depends on the solidarity fund holding a balance; "Poa charges
  nothing" is unconditionally true (no payment code exists in the product).
- **Accent is deep green (`meadow`), not brass.** Sanctioned by the brief's
  own list; chosen because Poa is the botanical name of meadow grass,
  because ledger green reads institutional rather than decorative, and
  because it passes AA/AAA at small mono sizes where brass fails. Palette
  is three families total: paper, ink, meadow.
- **Newsreader (serif, variable, self-hosted) + IBM Plex Mono.** Newsreader
  was on the brief's candidate list and its optical sizing gives display
  and text cuts from one file. Plex Mono is the "typewriter adjacent" mono:
  same skeleton, better numerals at 13px than Courier-likes. ~300KB of
  latin-subset woff2 in `public/fonts`; only the landing references the
  families, so app routes never download them. Hero faces are preloaded.
- **Buttons are set in mono.** The mono is the page's voice for the
  mechanical (numbers, dates, controls). Tested in both passes; it reads as
  letterpress furniture, not gimmick. Sentence case throughout.
- **Mono labels render uppercase via CSS** (`01 · THE USUAL STORY`,
  `SPECIMEN`). The sentence-case rule governs authored copy; small-caps
  exhibit labels are a typographic device of the charter genre, authored in
  sentence case and transformed in CSS. (Reversible by deleting one
  `textTransform`.)
- **The proof section is a link, not a number.** No usage data exists
  statically in the repo, so the page says what is structurally true (every
  org's rules, decisions, and books are public) and links to /explore.
  Nothing is counted, so nothing can go stale or be wrong.
- **The specimen is labeled `specimen / exhibit a`** with a screen-reader
  caption calling it illustrative. A fictional bakery shows the shape of a
  charter without claiming a real customer. Review pass 2 deleted its
  visible caption (redundant) and renamed `no. 0001` to `exhibit a` so it
  cannot be misread as "the first organization."
- **No closing CTA band.** The hero carries the one action, the footer's
  first link repeats it quietly. "Ready to Build?" died with the rest of
  the launch register.
- **Old section components were deleted**, not parked: HeroSection,
  ValuesSection, WhatIsPoa, UseCaseShowcase, FeatureCards, ClosingCTA,
  HowItWorks. They are in git history if ever wanted. Navbar/Footer remain
  for the routes that import them.
- **SEO keywords with banned vocabulary were dropped from meta and
  JSON-LD** ("no-code DAO", "on-chain voting", "decentralized governance",
  DAO-flavored `knowsAbout`). Required by hard rule 4; accepted cost
  against SEO_ROADMAP.md's keyword strategy (see TODO).
- **OG image regenerated in the new system** (paper, rules, serif, mark) at
  `/images/poa-og-charter.png` (34KB), passed only by the landing page; the
  old default OG stays for every other route.
- **Auth surfaces beyond the landing page were left alone.** The RainbowKit
  connect modal and sign-in/onboarding modals keep their own styling and
  copy (app scope). The landing's own label "Connect Wallet" was re-labeled
  "Connect"; the modal a user then opts into is third-party UI.

## Review loop notes

- Pass 1: zero banned words, zero em-dashes in rendered output (body, meta,
  JSON-LD, alts, hrefs); single H1 with clean H2/H3 outline; reduced-motion
  renders the hero at full opacity at first paint; focus rings visible on
  skip link, nav, buttons, and footer links. Fixed: 3-column grids waited
  for `lg` (at 768 the columns were too narrow), skip link focus ring moved
  to the palette.
- Pass 2 (the deletion pass): specimen caption to screen-reader-only,
  `exhibit a` rename, one ethos sentence cut, nav kept to three links.
  Final lint re-run clean against the production static export, including
  the E2E leakage guard (`yarn e2e:check`).

## Pass 3 (Hudson: "too basic, review flow and wording, not visually appealing")

The honest reading of the feedback: pass 2's deletion instinct overshot.
The system was right; the execution was timid. Pass 3 kept every rule
(paper/ink/one accent, serif/mono, no gradients, no stock anything) and
added the drama the genre actually has:

- Hero rebuilt on the logo's construction (rule, headline, rule), display
  size up, `that lasts.` in italic, corner folios (`est. 2024` / `poa.box`).
- Large green serif numerals beside every section heading; double rules
  (3px + hairline) at every opener; vignettes scaled to pull-quote size.
- Section 02 became steps-beside-specimen (sticky) so the mechanism is read
  against its result; the specimen gained a treasury row and a two-decision
  record.
- New section 03 "What an organization gets" (Votes/Tasks/Treasury/
  Members/Learning as annotated ledger rows): the page now demonstrates the
  product surface instead of only philosophizing about it. Flow became:
  problem → mechanism → product → properties → audience → ethos.
- Ethos inverted to a deep-green plate (the one color moment), with a
  colophon close ("Starting takes minutes. Lasting is the point.") and the
  action repeated once.
- Nav gained a compact Start button; wording sharpened throughout
  ("members who vouch for each other", "no shares to sell and no investors
  to please", "Ten years from now, a new member can read what was decided
  and why", "everything it built stayed borrowed").

All claims still trace to the audit; the vocabulary lint, heading
hierarchy, reduced motion, and contrast checks were re-run clean against
the rebuilt page (plate text is 9.5:1).

## Pass 4 (Hudson: "not colorful, too minimal, like a Google Slides
## template; first impressions must be impactful; poa is lowercase; this
## work secures public and worker ownership and is a public good")

Three directives, three responses:

1. **Color and impact.** The genre reference moved from university press
   to union broadside / WPA poster. New inks (oxblood, ochre) joined the
   green; the tri-color ribbon frames the hero and closes the footer; the
   vignettes print as three color plates; buttons and the specimen carry
   solid letterpress offset shadows; the footer is the poster's ink-black
   base. Every combination was contrast-checked (all text AA or better;
   ochre-on-paper is restricted to large decorative numerals at 3.6:1).
   The original brief's bans (gradients, glass, photos, motion) all still
   hold.
2. **Lowercase poa.** The visible uppercase came from the mono label's
   `textTransform` hitting the `poa.box` folio (rendering POA.BOX) plus
   capitalized "Poa" in running copy. The brand is now `poa` lowercase in
   all rendered text, the title tag, meta description, JSON-LD names, alt
   text, the © line, and the regenerated OG image. "Poa" remains only as a
   JSON-LD alternateName so search engines connect both spellings. A
   case-check script now guards this alongside the vocabulary lint.
3. **The mission.** The hero gained "Built for worker and community
   ownership."; the ethos now reads: "We built poa because worker and
   community ownership is how a better future gets made, and the tools for
   it should be a public good." Both verifiable (the templates are worker
   and community governance; the code is AGPL and free to use).

## Pass 5 (blank-slate review + casing clarification)

An independent cold review (no build context) scored the page 6/10 overall:
strong on distinctiveness (8) and clarity (7/7), weak on trust (4) and
desire (5). Its core findings and what was done:

- **"The headline says nothing; the subline is the real headline."** Fixed
  the cheap half: a category kicker now sits above the H1
  ("organizations owned by the people in them"), so the fold names the
  category before the poetry. The reviewer also called **"est. 2024" a
  heritage costume on a two year old product whose pitch is longevity**:
  cut from the hero and the OG image.
- **"The best trust sentence is buried."** "Every organization on Poa is
  public: its rules, its decisions, its books" was a footnote link; it is
  now a bordered band at trust-claim size closing section 05, with the
  link re-worded "Read the books for yourself."
- **Mobile nav hid "How it works" exactly where orientation is scarcest**:
  now visible at every width; "Browse" renamed "Organizations".
- **Copy fixes**: step one no longer enumerates all five templates (they
  appear again in 05); the Learning row dropped the jargon ("earn their
  standing") for "Onboarding courses your organization writes; passing
  them earns voting weight"; "The properties" running label became "The
  principles"; the ethos now says "because we believe", conviction rather
  than asserted fact; the specimen's toy treasury ($1,840.16) became
  $12,408.90 and its founding date moved to 2024 so it reads like a
  business, not a pizza fund.
- **Casing, clarified by Hudson**: "Poa" in prose is correct; "POA" is
  never acceptable. Prose, title, JSON-LD names, and og:site_name are back
  to "Poa" (lowercase "poa" kept as alternateName); the mono-label
  text-transform can no longer hit brand strings; the lint guard now
  targets all-caps POA.

Findings deliberately NOT acted on (need Hudson or conflict with hard
rules): naming the substrate plainly (banned vocabulary list), a "where
the money lives" custody/recovery section (needs verified product answers
on dues-in, passkey recovery, wind-down), signing the ethos with real
names, live counts at the fold, and replacing the specimen with a real
organization (the reviewer's #1; already a TODO below).

## TODO(hudson)

1. **Featured founding org.** If you want a real ledger entry on the page
   (name, founded date) for the first real organization, say which org and
   confirm it is public; the specimen slot can become a real entry. Nothing
   was invented in the meantime.
2. **SEO keyword retreat.** The banned-vocabulary rule removed every
   DAO/web3 keyword from meta and JSON-LD, which cuts against
   `poa-app/SEO_ROADMAP.md`. If discoverability for those queries still
   matters, that strategy needs a new home (docs pages already carry some
   of it) or a revised roadmap.
3. **Other routes still speak the old language.** /about, /docs content,
   /protocol, and the app itself use vocabulary the landing page now bans
   (the docs literally explain the substrate, reasonably so). Decide how
   far the vocabulary policy should propagate.
4. **est. 2024** is taken from the existing structured data
   (`foundingDate: "2024"`). If that date is wrong, it is wrong in two
   places now.

## With more time

- A second diagrammatic element for section 02: a thin-line vouch diagram
  (member → vouch → member) in the same ink, if a second illustration ever
  feels necessary. The page currently survives without it, which is better.
- Hover/focus polish on the specimen (e.g. a faint paper.200 row highlight)
  if it ever becomes interactive (linking to a real org).
- Self-host the app's Inter/Roboto Mono the same way the landing fonts are
  hosted, removing the Google Fonts request site-wide (perf + the same
  independence the footer sentence claims).
- Once a first founding organization agrees to be named, replace the
  specimen with the real entry: the strongest possible proof section.
