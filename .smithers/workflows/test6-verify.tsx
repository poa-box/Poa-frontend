  const implementPrompt = `You are implementing a focused frontend change in the poa-app/ Next.js app. This repo's CLAUDE.md is authoritative — follow it exactly (service layer for ALL contract calls via useWeb3Services, @/ imports never relative, Chakra theme + glassLayerStyle, no backdrop-filter, token amounts via formatTokenAmount, subgraph queries use the endpoint-specific client from useSubgraphClient/getClient, parseTaskId/parseProjectId for composite ids).

CHANGE REQUESTED:
${prompt}

Rules:
- Keep the diff focused and production-grade; touch only what the change needs.
- Do NOT start the dev server or a browser here — a later step verifies it.
- Return a summary and the exact list of files you changed.${feedback ? `\n\nPREVIOUS ATTEMPT FEEDBACK — fix every item before doing anything else:\n${feedback}` : ""}`;

  const verifyCommon = `See CLAUDE.md "Frontend changes: verify on Test6" for repo facts (Test6 authorization, identities).

DEV SERVER (operator-managed — do NOT start, restart, or kill one):
1. A single clean dev server is expected at ${baseUrl}. Check it first: \`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' ${baseUrl}\`.
2. If it returns 200, drive ALL Playwright navigation against ${baseUrl} (browser_navigate / browser_snapshot / browser_take_screenshot / browser_click / browser_fill_form).
3. If it does NOT return 200, STOP and report: set verified=false and issues="dev server on ${baseUrl} not healthy — operator must start one clean node dev server". Do NOT start your own: this repo's next dev servers share poa-app/.next/, so a second one races and corrupts webpack chunks (Cannot find module .../react-icons.js) — which is exactly what breaks pages in Chromium. Never spawn a competing server.
4. Save ALL screenshots/gifs UNDER ${arts.screenshots} (mkdir -p it first). NEVER write artifacts to the repo root — only .context/.smithers paths are gitignored. Return absolute screenshot paths in screenshotPaths for the design-review step.
5. Your FINAL message must be ONLY the JSON object — no prose, no code fences, no trailing text.

CHANGE TO VERIFY:

- Confirm the dev server: \`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' ${baseUrl}\` must be 200.
- Confirm the tested source is unchanged: \`${fingerprintCheck}\` must exit 0. If it exits non-zero the tested code drifted from the frozen snapshot (HMR or an edit) — STOP immediately, set verified=false and sourceStable=false, and explain. Do NOT mutate chain state on drifted code.
- SOURCE RE-CHECK RULE: re-run \`${fingerprintCheck}\` again immediately BEFORE every on-chain mutation (each proposal creation, each vote, the finalize). If it ever fails, abort with verified=false and sourceStable=false — never sign a tx after drift.`;

  const uiVerifyPrompt = `Verify the change in the browser — FAST and READ-ONLY. Do NOT send any on-chain transaction in this mode.

${verifyCommon}

Navigate to the relevant screen(s) and confirm the change renders and behaves correctly. If seeing the change requires specific existing data (e.g. an existing record/state), navigate to an org that already has it (read-only) rather than creating it. Do not click Save / Submit / Publish or anything that signs a tx.

Set verified=true only if the change renders and behaves correctly read-only. Put what you checked in flowsTested, problems in issues. (If the change genuinely cannot be verified without an on-chain write, say so in issues and set verified=false — the run can be re-launched with verifyDepth="onchain".)`;

  const runMarker = marker?.marker ?? "";
  const idsFile = marker?.idsFile ?? arts.ids;

  const createPrompt = `Verify the change on Test6 — the authorized Gnosis sandbox — by CREATING the proposal and CASTING the votes. Fire real tx there. This is phase 1 of 2 (a durable wait + finalize step follows).

${verifyCommon}

${preflight}

RUN MARKER (idempotence — lesson 1/3): this ENTIRE run's stable marker is:
  ${runMarker}
It is fixed for the whole run — a crash, this step re-running, or a later loop pass all reuse the SAME marker to recover the SAME proposal. NEVER derive a new marker or create a second proposal.
Persist on-chain identifiers to ${idsFile} as JSON the MOMENT each is known — before waiting on anything — so an interrupted run resumes. Use ARRAYS so multiple votes never clobber each other (lesson 8):
  {
    "marker": "${runMarker}",
    "proposalId": "<id once created>",
    "sourceFingerprint": "<output of: ${fingerprintCompute} at creation time>",
    "txHashes": ["<create tx>", "<vote tx>", ...],
    "userOpHashes": ["<create userOp>", "<vote userOp>", ...],
    "actions": [{ "kind": "create|vote|finalize", "txHash": "0x..", "userOpHash": "0x..", "at": "<iso>" }]
  }

RECOVER-BEFORE-CREATE (never duplicate a proposal):
1. First read ${idsFile} if it exists, and query the org's subgraph for a proposal whose title/description carries the marker "${runMarker}".
2. If such a proposal already exists AND its recorded "sourceFingerprint" equals the CURRENT one (\`${fingerprintCompute}\`): DO NOT create another. Resume it — cast any missing votes, then report its ids.
3. If a proposal exists but the recorded fingerprint DIFFERS from the current source (a later loop iteration re-implemented the code), the existing proposal can no longer represent the code under test: ABORT — set verified=false, sourceStable=false, explain that a FRESH run is required, and do NOT create a duplicate.
4. Only if NO proposal exists yet: create exactly one — put the marker "${runMarker}" in its title or description so it is discoverable on resume, and record its "sourceFingerprint" (\`${fingerprintCompute}\`) to ${idsFile} immediately.

FLOW (begin the browser tx PROMPTLY once preflight passes — do not linger exploring):
- Seed any required on-chain state on Test6 if the flow needs it.
- Create the proposal (re-check source first), append its tx/userOp hashes + an "actions" entry to ${idsFile}.
- Cast the votes needed to reach quorum (re-check source before each vote), appending each vote's hashes to the arrays.
- Capture screenshots of the created proposal + cast votes under ${arts.screenshots}.

HARD STOP: if the flow would touch a mainnet org, a multi-sig broadcast, or anything that burns real value, set verified=false and touchedMainnet=true and explain — do NOT execute it.

Set verified=false at THIS phase (finalization + assertions happen in phase 2). Return proposalId, the FULL txHashes/userOpHashes arrays and actions list (plus the singular txHash/userOpHash for the create tx for backwards compat), runMarker="${runMarker}", the screenshotPaths, flowsTested, and set sourceStable to reflect the source re-checks. Put problems in issues.`;

  const finalizePrompt = `Finalize and ASSERT the Test6 proposal created in phase 1. This is phase 2 of 2; a durable timer already waited out the voting window.

${verifyCommon}

${preflight}

RESUME (never re-create): read ${idsFile} and locate the proposal by its recorded proposalId or by the marker "${runMarker}" in the subgraph. Operate on THAT proposal only. If the recorded "sourceFingerprint" no longer matches the current source (\`${fingerprintCompute}\`), the proposal is stale — set verified=false, sourceStable=false, and require a fresh run instead of finalizing stale code.

FINALIZE:
- Confirm the voting window has elapsed and the proposal is finalizable. If not quite ready, poll briefly.
- Re-check source (\`${fingerprintCheck}\`) immediately before finalizing, then finalize/execute (e.g. announceWinner) and watch the tx.
- Append the finalize tx/userOp hashes to the txHashes/userOpHashes arrays and add an "actions" entry (kind="finalize") in ${idsFile} (lesson 8) — do not overwrite the create/vote hashes.

ASSERTIONS — set verified=true ONLY if ALL hold (report each in flowsTested; any failure → verified=false + issues):
1. The finalize tx has a SUCCESSFUL receipt.
2. NO ProposalExecutionFailed event was emitted for this proposal.
3. The intended on-chain post-state change was actually applied (read it back on-chain) AND is reflected in the subgraph after re-index.
4. An UNRELATED piece of state was left unchanged (negative control).
5. The subgraph is internally consistent for this proposal (status/votes/execution match chain).

Capture finalize screenshots under ${arts.screenshots}. Return screenshotPaths INCLUDING the phase-1 shots (${arts.screenshots}), proposalId, the FULL txHashes/userOpHashes arrays and actions list (plus singular txHash = the finalize tx for backwards compat), runMarker="${runMarker}", flowsTested, sourceStable, and any issues.`;

  const shots = verify?.screenshotPaths ?? [];
  const designReviewPrompt = `You are an INDEPENDENT design reviewer. You did not build this change. The implementation was just verified and captured these screenshots${verify?.gifPath ? ` plus a gif (${verify.gifPath})` : ""}:
${shots.length ? shots.map((p) => `- ${p}`).join("\n") : "(no screenshots captured — if so, set approved=false and say the verify step produced no visual evidence)"}

Read EACH screenshot image with the Read tool (it renders images visually). Judge ONLY the visual / UX quality of the change below:
- Does it look polished and production-grade?
- Does it fit poa's EXISTING design system: glass morphism (glassLayerStyle / glassLayerLightStyle), the custom coral / rose / amethyst / warmGray palette, the typographic style already used on the page, consistent spacing & alignment?
- Does it match the surrounding existing UI rather than inventing a new visual language?
- Are empty states, loading states, and any cards visually clean and legible (incl. mobile if shown)?
