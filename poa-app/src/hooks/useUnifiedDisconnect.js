 * The wagmi bindings for Poa's one correct sign-out.
 *
 * Lives here rather than beside a single button because more than one surface
 * offers "Disconnect" (the shared account menu, and the connected-account badge
 * on /join). Each one that rolls its own `signOut()` + bare `disconnect()` pair
 * re-introduces the same two bugs: a stored passkey re-attaching, and a second
 * live connector being promoted so the UI still shows an address.
 *
 * The ordering and fan-out rules themselves are pure and live in
 * `lib/auth/unifiedDisconnect`, where they are covered by a runtime test.
