/**
 * voteOpenRights — who may OPEN a vote in this group, in this group's own words.
 *
 * The rules panel used to guess ("Members with a creator role… polls are open
 * more widely") and then apologise for guessing ("creator roles set at
 * deployment may not be listed"). Both were wrong: the two creator sets come
 * from useVoteCreateGate — the SAME arrays that enable the Create-vote button —
 * and in every live group the poll set is equal to or NARROWER than the binding
 * set, never wider.
 *
 * So this module never states a relationship between the two tracks. It renders
 * both sets: one row when they match, two rows when they diverge. The reader
 * compares them; nobody has to write a comparison that could be false.
 *
 * Three claims, all computed, never assumed:
 *   - WHO   — the group's own role names, and only names it can resolve. A hat
 *             outside the org's role list is counted ("and 1 more role"), never
 *             invented into "Unknown Role" or printed as a 77-digit id.
 *   - HOW MANY — "Every role" when the set covers every named role (true for
 *             most groups), otherwise "2 of 5 roles". Always a statement about
 *             ROLES: a creator role can have no wearers at all.
 *   - IS THAT ME — an affirmative chip when the viewer can open one, and an
 *             explicit line when a member cannot. Silence is not an answer.
 *
 * An EMPTY set fails CLOSED, matching the contract (HatManager.hasAnyHat returns
 * false on a zero-length array, so only the executor — a passed vote — is left).
 * It is never rendered as "any member", and it never keeps its propose button:
 * useVoteCreateGate deliberately fails OPEN there, and that hedge must not leak
 * into copy that claims a right. A read that FAILED is a third state again, so
 * an RPC hiccup can never masquerade as either extreme.
 *
 * Pure module (no React) so every branch is unit-testable; OrgConstitution only
 * maps the icon keys to components.
