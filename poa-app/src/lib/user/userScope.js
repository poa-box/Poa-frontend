/**
 * Account-scoping rules for UserContext.
 *
 * Every value UserContext exposes belongs to one (org, account) pair. Two
 * Apollo behaviours make that easy to get wrong, and both produced the
 * "someone else's profile is still on screen" class of bug:
 *
 *   - When a query becomes `skip`ped, Apollo keeps returning the previous
 *     `data`. Disconnecting therefore leaves the last user's roles and tasks
 *     readable.
 *   - When variables change (account A -> B), the old `data` is still returned
 *     for a render or two before the new result lands.
 *
 * So results are matched against the *current* scope before they are trusted,
 * and loading is derived rather than latched.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free so the rules are covered by real runtime tests.
