// Bake-off control copy (P1). All three direction prototypes import this module
// verbatim — identical copy is the controlled variable so judges score design,
// not words. Direction-specific wording is allowed ONLY in microcopy (figure
// labels, plate captions, data-chip labels), never in these strings.
// Vocab: obeys docs/landing-overhaul-v2/BRIEF.md §3 (checked with check-vocab.mjs --src).
// Final shipping copy is chosen later at Gate 2; do not wordsmith here.
