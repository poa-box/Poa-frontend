/**
 * Access v2 GraphQL documents — the MembershipAuthority model.
 *
 * Kept in their own module (re-exported from `util/queries.js`, so the "import queries from
 * util/queries" convention still holds) for ONE reason: every document in here selects fields that
 * DO NOT EXIST on the endpoints the app reads today. The app talks to the DECENTRALISED GATEWAY
 * subgraphs, which lag Studio by a manual publish, and a single unknown field fails the WHOLE
 * document — so mixing these selections into the existing org queries would break every legacy org
 * page the moment this branch shipped.
 *
 * EVERY consumer of these documents MUST gate on `CAPABILITY.ACCESS_V2` (see
 * `util/subgraphCapabilities`) plus the org's own authority binding. See
 * `lib/accessV2/authority.js`.
 *
 * Shapes are taken verbatim from `pop-subgraph/schema.graphql` on the access-v2/subgraph branch.

/**

 *
 * The `accepted` branch is what makes the grant-vs-offer decision match the contract: `_isInOrg` is
 * `userSubjectList[user].length > 0` — accepted ANYWHERE, regardless of current eligibility — so
 * an accepted-but-lapsed member is in-org on chain. Without this branch those rows are invisible
 * here and the wizard classifies a real member as an outsider needing an invitation.
 *
 * FILTER SHAPE IS LOAD-BEARING: graph-node REJECTS a column filter that sits next to `or` at the
 * same level — `where: { authority: $a, or: [...] }` fails the whole document with "Cannot mix
 * column filters with 'or' operator at the same level". The scope has to be DISTRIBUTED into every
 * `or` branch instead. This is a graph-node filter-grammar rule, not a schema one, so the
 * capability probe cannot catch it (every selected field exists) — `queriesAccessV2.grammar.test.js`
 * lints it offline and `queriesAccessV2.live.test.js` executes it against a real graph-node.
