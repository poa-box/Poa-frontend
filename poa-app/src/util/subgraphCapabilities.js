/**
 * subgraphCapabilities — runtime feature detection for subgraph schema fields.
 *
 * Adding a field the serving subgraph doesn't have errors the ENTIRE query
 * (the org-metadata ordering rule), so new-field consumption must self-enable.
 * We introspect the schema once per (subgraph URL, capability), cache the
 * answer in localStorage, and let callers pick the richer query only when it's
 * safe.
 *
 * This matters more than it looks: the app's default endpoints are the
 * DECENTRALIZED GATEWAY subgraphs (see config/networks.js), which lag Studio by
 * a manual publish. A field can be merged, deployed and live on Studio while
 * the endpoint the app actually reads still doesn't serve it — so "the subgraph
 * has it" is never safe to assume from the schema file.
 *
 * Detected capabilities:
 *   PROPOSAL_PROPOSER — subgraph-pop #195, proposer attribution.
 *   TASK_RELEASES     — subgraph-pop #201, TaskManager v7 claim release.
 *   ACCESS_V2         — subgraph-pop access-v2 wave, the MembershipAuthority model.
 *
 * Once an org's endpoint serves the newer version the feature lights up with no
 * frontend change.
