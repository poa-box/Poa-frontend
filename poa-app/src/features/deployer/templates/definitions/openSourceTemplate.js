  // Philosophy - The WHY behind this model
  philosophy: {
    essence: `Open source projects succeed when those who contribute most help guide
the project's direction. But healthy open source isn't a closed club—it's a ladder
that anyone can climb through contribution. The best projects balance rewarding
active contributors with keeping the door open for newcomers.

**Hybrid voting** makes this concrete: the 30/70 split means 30% of voting power
comes from simply being a contributor (democracy), while 70% comes from your
shares (meritocracy). Active maintainers guide the project, but
newcomers always have a voice and path to influence.`,

    keyPrinciple: `Meritocracy is earned through contribution, but the path to
contribution must stay open. Weight decisions toward active contributors while
ensuring newcomers have voice and visibility.`,

    historicalContext: `Projects like Linux, Apache, and Python demonstrate that
successful open source governance evolves over time. Most successful projects start
more democratic to attract contributors, then shift toward meritocracy as the
contributor base matures. The key is that influence is always earnable through
contribution—never inherited or purchased.`,

    whatHybridVotingMeans: `When your project votes with a 30/70 hybrid system:
- 30% of voting power comes from being a contributor (everyone equal)
- 70% comes from shares (earned through merged PRs, reviews, docs, etc.)

**Example:** Voting on a breaking API change in a 20-contributor project:
- A core maintainer with 500 shares might have ~8% of total voting power
- A new contributor with 10 shares might have ~2%
- But that new contributor's voice still matters, and their influence grows with every contribution`,
