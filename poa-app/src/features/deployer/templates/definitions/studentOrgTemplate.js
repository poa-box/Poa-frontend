  // Philosophy - The WHY behind this model
  philosophy: {
    essence: `Student organizations are more than clubs—they're training grounds for
democratic citizenship. The goal isn't just to run events or manage projects; it's
to practice the skills of collective decision-making, leadership, and accountability.
Making mistakes here is valuable—it's much better to learn governance lessons as a
student than as an adult with real consequences.

**The 70/30 hybrid voting system** prioritizes democratic equality while still rewarding
engagement: most of your voting power is automatic (everyone matters), and active
participants earn additional influence (showing up matters too). It's real governance practice.`,

    keyPrinciple: `Prioritize equal voice while rewarding engagement. The 70/30 split
gives every member strong democratic power while recognizing those who step up.
Elections for executives teach both leadership and accountability.
Education hub is essential—good governance requires understanding.`,

    historicalContext: `Student government has existed as long as universities have.
Organizations like student unions, fraternities, and clubs have always served as
laboratories for democracy. The best student organizations produce future leaders
who understand how to build consensus, manage conflict, and serve communities.`,

    whatHybridVotingMeans: `With 70/30 hybrid voting in your student org:
- 70% of voting power comes from membership (every member equal)
- 30% comes from contribution tokens (earned through engagement)

**Example:** Voting on next semester's budget in a 50-member club:
- Every member has at least 1.4% voting power just from being a member
- An exec who attends every meeting and runs events might have 2.5-3%
- A member who just joined has 1.5%
- Everyone has strong voice, but active contributors earn additional influence`,
