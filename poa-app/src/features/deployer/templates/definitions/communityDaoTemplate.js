  // Philosophy - The WHY behind this model
  philosophy: {
    essence: `Communities exist wherever people share something—a neighborhood, an
interest, a profession, a cause. When communities govern themselves, they make
better decisions because they understand local context and live with the results.
The challenge is making governance accessible enough that everyone can participate,
while still rewarding those who consistently show up.

**Hybrid voting with a 50/50 split** captures this balance perfectly: half your
voting power comes from membership (democracy), half from engagement (participation
tokens). Everyone matters, but those who consistently show up have earned more
influence. It's the digital town hall that actually works.`,

    keyPrinciple: `Balance voice with presence. Everyone deserves the right to
participate, but those who consistently engage with governance have earned
additional influence. The 50/50 split between democracy and participation
reflects this balance.`,

    historicalContext: `From town halls to online forums, communities have always
found ways to make collective decisions. Blockchain adds transparency and programmable
rules to ancient practices of community governance. Successful organizations like GitcoinDAO
and Bankless prove that decentralized communities can coordinate at scale.`,

    whatHybridVotingMeans: `With a 50/50 hybrid in your community organization:
- 50% of voting power comes from membership (one person, one vote)
- 50% comes from participation tokens (earned through engagement)

**Example:** Voting on a community grant program in a 100-member organization:
- Every member has at least 0.5% voting power just from membership
- A highly engaged member who attends meetings and contributes might have 2-3%
- A casual member who rarely participates might have 0.6%
- This rewards engagement while ensuring everyone's voice counts`,
