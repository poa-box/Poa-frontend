# POA Frontend

This `AGENTS.md` is the canonical repository guidance for coding agents.
`CLAUDE.md` imports it for compatibility with existing tools and workflows.

## Product purpose and voice

Poa makes worker and community ownership practical: the people doing the work and
the communities it serves can share in decisions, value, and a lasting future.
Censorship resistance matters because that ownership should remain in their hands,
with organizations able to keep going independently of any one platform operator.
Express this warmly through shared agency, care, and possibility. Keep product copy
approachable and inspiring; avoid polarizing, partisan, or heavily libertarian
language. Loading reflections are original drafts in
`poa-app/src/components/shared/loadingQuotes.js`, ready for Hudson's own writing.

## Member-facing language and Shares

Use plain product language in member-facing pages, dialogs, form labels, empty
states, loading text, and notifications. Prefer words such as members, organization,
Shares, rewards, learning, and voting. Do not introduce Web3 jargon such as tokens,
minting, gas, smart contracts, IPFS, subgraphs, or on-chain transactions into these
flows. Describe the action or outcome people care about accurately; keep underlying
implementation details in developer-facing code and documentation.

**Shares is the default reward and ownership label.** Organization settings can opt
into the participation symbol with the `useTokenSymbol` flag. The canonical resolver
is `resolveTokenLabel({ useTokenSymbol, symbol: participationTokenSymbol })` in
`@/util/tokenLabel`: only an explicit `true` flag and a nonblank symbol use that
symbol; otherwise it returns `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LABEL` (`'Shares'`). Preserve the
configured symbol's case. Never lowercase or uppercase the resolved label.

- Components should consume `usePOContext().tokenLabel`, with
  `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LABEL` imported from `@/util/tokenLabel` as the fallback. Use this
  label consistently in headings, balances, rewards, input units, buttons, dialogs,
  and notifications. Do not hardcode `Token`, `tokens`, or other competing labels,
  and do not add `$` prefixes to reward or ownership amounts.
- `POContext` resolves the label from organization metadata's `useTokenSymbol`
  and `participationTokenSymbol`. The organization settings editor persists that
  flag. Honor the setting rather than inferring a preference from the presence of
  a symbol. When constructing data outside the context, call `resolveTokenLabel`
  instead of duplicating its logic.
- Preview, tour, fixture, and sample data must follow the same resolver and
  organization configuration as live data. A preview must not silently switch
  vocabulary or invent its own default.
- Verify both modes for affected UI: default/missing or disabled `useTokenSymbol`
  displays `Shares`; enabled symbol mode displays the configured symbol with its
  original case. Also check that an enabled setting with an empty or missing symbol
  falls back to `Shares`. Include forms, dialogs, and preview/sample data in this
  check, not just the page heading.

```javascript
import { usePOContext } from '@/context/POContext';
import { DEFAULT_TOKEN_LABEL } from '@/util/tokenLabel';

// Inside an organization component:
const { tokenLabel = DEFAULT_TOKEN_LABEL } = usePOContext();
```

## Commands

All commands run from `poa-app/`:

```bash
cd poa-app && yarn dev              # dev server
cd poa-app && yarn dev:e2e          # dev server in E2E mode (burner EOA auto-connects)
cd poa-app && yarn dev:e2e-passkey  # dev server in E2E mode, passkey identity
cd poa-app && yarn build            # production build (static export to IPFS)
cd poa-app && yarn lint             # ESLint + Next.js Core Web Vitals rules
cd poa-app && yarn test             # vitest (unit tests for the pure `src/lib/**` layer)
cd poa-app && yarn e2e:setup        # one-time machine setup (writes ~/.poa/e2e.env)
cd poa-app && yarn e2e:check        # CI guard — fails if E2E code leaks into prod bundle
cd poa-app && yarn e2e:test-passkey # virtual-passkey crypto self-test
```

Automated coverage is vitest over the pure layer (colocated `*.test.js`, mostly
`src/lib/**` + `src/util/**`) plus the E2E harness. React-coupled code has no unit
tests — drive it through Test6 instead. No Prettier. No formatting commands.

## Frontend changes: verify on Test6

To make AND verify a frontend change, drive it through the **`test6-verify`** Smithers
workflow (see the Smithers section) — it *enforces* the implement → build → Test6
Playwright verification (gif) → review loop. Doing it inline? Follow the same flow by
hand. Either way these repo facts hold:

- **Test6 (Gnosis) is the sandbox — fire real tx there.** Both agent identities (burner
  EOA + passkey) are authorized for every permission-gated flow. **Stop** for mainnet
  orgs, multi-sig broadcasts, or anything that would burn real value.
- Dev server: `cd poa-app && yarn dev:e2e-passkey` (passkey identity, full perms,
  auto-connects). Use `yarn dev:e2e` (burner EOA) only to test as an unvouched /
  minimal-permission user or the direct-EOA tx path. Never plain `yarn dev` for agent
  work. `yarn e2e:setup` is one-time per laptop (writes `~/.poa/e2e.env`).
- **Run ONE dev server, under Node 22.23.2 (not bun).** Multiple `next dev` processes
  share `poa-app/.next/` and corrupt each other's webpack chunks → `Cannot find
  module ./chunks/vendor-chunks/react-icons.js` → pages 500 in the browser (this is
  what breaks Playwright/Chromium). If chunks break: `lsof -ti:<port> | xargs kill -9`,
  `rm -rf poa-app/.next`, then start a single server.
- Browser testing uses the Playwright MCP (`.mcp.json`). Share a **gif** (gitignored:
  `/*.gif`, `/poa-app/*.gif`), not PNGs.
- Before a PR touching E2E-intercepted files (`AuthContext.js`, `_app.js`,
  `passkeySign.js`, `passkeyCreate.js`, `ProviderConverter.jsx`, anything under
  `src/services/e2e/`): `yarn build && yarn e2e:check` (no E2E symbols in the prod bundle).

Full E2E docs: `poa-app/scripts/e2e/README.md`. Known follow-ups: `BACKLOG.md` next to it.

## Smithers (durable agent orchestration)

`.smithers/` holds Smithers workflows that run long / multi-step / verify-heavy work
as durable, resumable runs. The agent operates Smithers on the user's behalf — don't
hand these commands to the user.

- **When to reach for it:** work with phases, iterate-until-pass loops, Test6
  verification, runs while the user is away, or that spans repos. Skip it for
  one-shot edits or quick questions — do those inline.
- **`test6-verify` is the standard verify loop.** It *automates* the "Default workflow
  for agents" Test6 flow above — implement → `yarn build` gate → Playwright
  verification on Test6 (real tx + a recorded gif) → independent code review →
  independent design review of the screenshots, looping until all pass:
  `bunx smithers-orchestrator workflow run test6-verify --prompt "<change>"`
- Spawned agents run at the repo root and **read this AGENTS.md** (also imported by `CLAUDE.md`), so the Test6 / E2E
  details above are the shared source of truth for both inline work and Smithers runs
  — keep them here rather than duplicating them into the workflow.
- **Catalog:** `bunx smithers-orchestrator workflow list`. **Watch a run:**
  `bunx smithers-orchestrator ps | inspect <id> | logs <id> -f | ui <id>`.
- Always invoke as `bunx smithers-orchestrator <cmd>` (never bare `smithers` — that's
  an unrelated npm package).

## Stack

Next.js 16, React 18, **JavaScript** (not TypeScript). Chakra UI 2. Wagmi 2 + ethers 5 + viem 2.
Static export (`output: 'export'`). Yarn. Node 22.23.2 (Volta).

## Path Aliases

`@/*` maps to `poa-app/src/*` (jsconfig.json). Always use `@/` imports, never relative `../../`.
ABIs live at `poa-app/abi/` (outside src) — import with `../../abi/FooBar.json`.

## Gotchas

### Three util directories — don't confuse them

- `src/util/` — queries, apolloClient, formatToken, permissions, tokens, crossChainUsername, etc.
- `src/utils/` — profileUtils.js only
- `src/services/web3/utils/` — encoding.js (IPFS CID conversion, parseTaskId, parseProjectId)

`encoding.js` is in `services/web3/utils/`, NOT in `src/util/`.

### Dual auth system

AuthContext unifies EOA (RainbowKit/wagmi) and Passkey (ERC-4337 smart accounts).
- EOA uses `TransactionManager` (direct ethers tx)
- Passkey uses `SmartAccountTransactionManager` (UserOp via Pimlico bundler)
- `useWeb3Services()` returns the correct manager based on auth type automatically
- **Never** call ethers/viem directly from components — always go through services

### Token amounts are always 18-decimal wei from subgraph

Use `formatTokenAmount()` / `parseTokenAmount()` from `src/util/formatToken.js`.
Getting this wrong produces numbers that are 10^18 too large or too small.

### Subgraph queries need chain routing

Org-scoped queries must pass a per-endpoint client: `useQuery(QUERY, { client:
useSubgraphClient(subgraphUrl) })` (subgraphUrl from POContext), or
`getClient(subgraphUrl)` for imperative queries. Without it, queries hit the
default (Arbitrum) subgraph and return wrong-chain data.

Each endpoint gets its OWN ApolloClient + InMemoryCache, so cross-chain cache
poisoning is structurally impossible — no `fetchPolicy: 'no-cache'` needed for
that. The old `context: { subgraphUrl }` plumbing is deprecated (apolloClient.js);
do not use it in new code. For query-all-chains fan-outs, use the helpers in
`src/util/crossChainUsername.js` (queryAllChains pattern).

### Subgraph IDs have composite format

Entity IDs from The Graph: `"{contractAddress}-{numericId}"`. Contracts expect
just the numeric part. Use `parseTaskId()`, `parseProjectId()`, `parseModuleId()`
from `services/web3/utils/encoding.js`. Wrong format = silent contract reverts.

### Org-scoped state via query param

All org pages read `router.query.userDAO`. POContext uses this to resolve `orgId`,
`subgraphUrl`, `orgChainId`. If `userDAO` is missing, POContext provides nulls —
this is expected on non-org pages.

### DirectDemocracy is polls-only — any executing proposal goes to HybridVoting

`OrgDeployer` sets `Executor.setCaller(hybridVoting)` on every org, and DirectDemocracy's
target allow-list is empty on every deploy, so a DD proposal carrying a batch reverts
`TargetNotAllowed` at creation (and could never execute anyway). Route on the BATCH, not the
intent name: `votingLaneForBatches(batches)` in `components/voting/create/wizardSteps.js`
(`BINDING_TYPES` there is the one list the gallery badges, creator gate and routing share).

### Three money pots, one word "treasury"

The Executor is what POContext aliases as `treasuryContractAddress` and is what a passed
batch spends directly, but "Deposit to treasury" lands in the **PaymentManager** (owner ==
Executor; `withdraw` only by vote) and task rewards are paid from the **TaskManager**'s own
balance. `lib/voting/treasuryBatches.js` encodes a payout from either source (PaymentManager
funds committed to an unfinalized distribution are NOT spendable — fully-claimed rounds get
closed in-batch first) and `hooks/useOrgPotBalances.js` reads all three.

### Access v2 orgs (MembershipAuthority) — gate on `useOrgAuthority().enabled`

On a cut-over org (Test6 since 2026-08-27) creator/voter/task permissions are read from the
authority, not the legacy hat tables: `setCreatorHatAllowed`, DD `HAT_ALLOWED` and
`setProjectRolePerm` still succeed on chain but change nothing (flagged `legacyOnly` in
`setterDefinitions.js`, filtered by `lib/voting/setterAvailability.js`), the vote-creator gate
folds authority perms (`lib/voting/createGate.js`), and role pickers list authority subjects
(`lib/voting/roleOptions.js`). When `enabled` is false every one of these must render exactly
the legacy UI.

### Optimistic updates have grace period locks

UserContext (15s) and TaskBoardContext (65s) use `optimisticLockRef` to prevent stale
subgraph data from overwriting optimistic state. The subgraph has indexing delay —
do not reduce these timeouts.

### IPFS CID ↔ bytes32 encoding

Contracts store IPFS content as bytes32. Use `ipfsCidToBytes32(cid)` and
`bytes32ToIpfsCid(hash)` from `services/web3/utils/encoding.js`.
CIDs must be CIDv0 (start with "Qm"). CIDv1 will not work.

### Pages are thin wrappers

Page files in `src/pages/` should only import components and set up routing. All
business logic and UI lives in `src/components/` or `src/features/`. Do not add
logic to page files.

## Conventions

### Service layer is mandatory for all contract calls

```
services/web3/core/    → ContractFactory, TransactionManager, SmartAccountTransactionManager
services/web3/domain/  → UserService, VotingService, TaskService, EducationService, etc.
```

Components use hooks (`useWeb3Services`, `useWeb3`) to get services. Use
`useTransactionWithNotification().executeWithNotification()` for the pending → success/error
notification flow.

### RefreshContext for cross-context data updates

After a transaction, emit a `RefreshEvent` (e.g., `TASK_CREATED`, `PROPOSAL_VOTED`).
Other contexts subscribe via `useRefreshSubscription`. Do NOT import contexts into
each other to trigger refetches — that creates circular dependencies.

### Error handling

`ErrorParser.js` in `src/lib/errors/` maps 26+ custom contract error selectors and
revert strings to user-friendly messages. Let the service layer's error parsing handle
contract errors — do not catch and reformat them in components.

### Multi-chain architecture

- **Arbitrum** (42161) = home chain (accounts, usernames, infrastructure)
- **Gnosis** (100) = default org deployment chain
- **Sepolia** / **Base Sepolia** = testnets

Config in `src/config/networks.js`. Never hardcode chain IDs.

### Chakra UI theme

Custom palettes: `coral`, `rose`, `amethyst`, `warmGray` — not standard Chakra colors.
Custom variants: `glass`, `elevated`, `primary`. Theme is defined inline in `_app.js`.

### Provider nesting order matters

The provider tree is dependency-sensitive. `RegistryProvider.jsx` and
`OrganizationReadProviders.jsx` own public data and caches. Stable wallet/auth
facades surround `OrganizationProviders.jsx`, whose single `Web3ServicesProvider`
owns service demand below PO/User. `AccountRuntimeHost.jsx` loads `CoreProviders.jsx`
as a **sibling of the page**; its real wagmi/Auth/Rainbow providers host account and
signing implementations without replacing public readers or form state. Components
outside that island import wallet hooks from `@/context/WalletContext` and auth from
`@/context/authState`, never directly from wagmi or RainbowKit. Pending
`isAuthHydrated: false` is unresolved identity, not an anonymous/nonmember answer.
`accountHint` is an untrusted saved address used only by `AccountReadWarmup` to
prefetch public cache entries; never use it for permissions, signing, or resolved
member state. Actual readers must match the restored account and organization.
Fully static reading routes skip the application bundles. Check these modules and
`_app.js` before adding or reordering providers.

### Task permissions

Hat-based permission system matching `TaskPerm.sol`. Resolve a whole project at once with
`projectTaskPermissions(project, userHatIds, address)` from `src/util/permissions.js`, and
use `taskEditRights(perms, columnId)` for the edit/delete affordances. It mirrors
TaskManager's `_checkPerm` exactly:

```
_checkPerm(pid, FLAG) = TaskPerm.has(_permMask(sender, pid), FLAG) || _isPM(pid, sender)
```

Three rules people keep getting wrong:

- **The global fallback is per-hat.** A hat's *non-zero* per-project mask REPLACES its
  global mask (it does not OR); a zero/absent project mask falls back to global.
- **`_isPM` is the only human bypass** — being a manager of *that* project
  (`Project.managers`, fetched by `FETCH_PROJECT_MANAGERS`, deliberately its own document
  so an endpoint without the field can't blank the board). `BUDGET` is the one permission
  with **no** manager bypass (`_requireBudgetEditor`).
- **There is no "executive" hat.** Role order in `roleHatIds` carries zero authority —
  Argus deployed its senior role first, so `roleHatIds[1]` is its *junior* role. Never gate
  on a role index; gate on the contract that enforces the action (`projectTaskPermissions`,
  `useVoteCreateGate`, `useEducationCreateGate`, `creatorHatIds` for projects,
  `hasApproverRole` for token approvals).

### Glass morphism styling

Use `glassLayerStyle` / `glassLayerLightStyle` from `@/components/shared/glassStyles`.
These are used in 40+ files. Do NOT use `backdrop-filter: blur()` — it was removed
for Safari CPU performance. The constants use opacity-based fallbacks instead.

## Environment Variables

All prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_PIMLICO_API_KEY` is required for passkey auth.
RPCs and subgraph URLs have hardcoded fallbacks in `config/networks.js`.
No `.env` file is committed — defaults work for read-only browsing.

E2E mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_MODE=true`) reads `~/.poa/e2e.env` (machine-level,
shared across workspaces). All `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_*` vars are force-inlined at
build time via webpack `DefinePlugin` in `next.config.mjs` so production builds
tree-shake every E2E branch. The `yarn e2e:check` guard verifies this on every
build. Never read these env vars at runtime in non-E2E code paths.
